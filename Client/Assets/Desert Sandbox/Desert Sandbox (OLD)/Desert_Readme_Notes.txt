Desert Sandbox: (V:1.5)

•	All new textures and items are in the "Update 1.5" folder.
•	In the folder contains a bunch of new textures, and a couple hundred prefabs, game ready, to place in your scenes. 
There are 160+ new modular buildings and walls that I have included. (All which share the "Dogon Housing" materials included)

Any house models, under any housing folders all share materials with the "Dogon Housing Mats" 
Provided with 4 unique and different textures included(each texture having 4 looks, for a total of 16 looks!). 
By combining these textures with your models in game, you can really spruce up a scene majorly!

•	I have provided this update with a major update to many of the previous textures
(due to texture stretching and overall bad qualities in previous releases!) 
Now there are many different possibilities for texturing in this package. And texture qualities have improved quite a bunch

This is part 1/2 of my major update to this package. By the end of the summer, version 2.0 will be released, with more prefabs, textures, particles, etc.

Thank you for purchasing, and if you have any questions don't hesitate to email me!
